          <p>Warp is a particle-in-cell code designed to simulate high intensity charged particle beams and plasmas using state-of-the-art electrostatic and electromagnetic solvers. Warp’s electrostatic capabilities include advanced treatments of conducting and dielectric structures. Sirepo leverages these electrostatic features for the modeling and simulation of thermionic energy converters, devices designed to generate electricity from the thermionic emission of electrons.</p>
          <p>This Sirepo implementation of Warp is a proof-of-principle, which supports 2D Cartestian PIC modeling of thermionic converters, a type of nanoelectronic device (VND).</p>
          <p>At present, Sirepo supports a small subset of Warp’s capabilities. The full capabilities of Warp can be accessed from a <a href="#/jupyter">Jupyter server</a>. Jupyter servers are cloud based simulations of an HPC server, with nothing to install.</p>
          <p>The Warp source code is available on Bitbucket.</p>
          <p>The code is developed and supported at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Warp is part of the Berkeley Lab Accelerator Simulation Toolkit.</p>
