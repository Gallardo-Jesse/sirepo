        <div>
            <p>Fourth generation storage ring light sources are creating orders-of-magnitude brighter x-rays by reducing horizontal dispersion via multibend achromats. This requires the bending magnet pole tips to be closer to the electron beam axis, which in turn requires smaller vacuum chambers. Aperture diameters are in the 50 - 150 mm range for third generation light sources, while next generation sources require diameters < 30 mm. The combination of chamber size reduction and more intense synchrotron radiation leads to new design considerations. Larger heat loads may cause structural damage or decrease the accuracy of beam position monitors. Vacuum conductance is decreased, while residual gas pressures due to photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) are elevated and more difficult to moderate via traditional photon absorbers. To better analyze and optimize next generation vacuum systems, the authors are developing and benchmarking a suite of COMSOL Multiphysics models, which include the production propagation, reflection and absorption of synchrotron x-rays, as well as the resulting physical phenomena noted above.</p>
          <p>The Application Builder feature in COMSOL Multiphysics enables the creation of browser-based GUIs, which enable scientists and engineers to study this complicated problem domain without becoming an expert user of COMSOL. </p>
