            <p>Synergia is a flexible accelerator simulation code with 3D space charge and impedance-driven wake fields. The available algorithms range from simple/fast to computationally intensive, with the goal of having the best available physics models. Synergia is designed for a range of computing resources, from laptops to supercomputers. Single-particle dynamics is provided by CHEF, which offers direct symplectic tracking through magnets, cavities, drifts, etc. and/or arbitrary-order polynomial maps. CHEF also provides nonlinear map analysis (including normal forms), lattice functions, tune and chromaticity calculation/adjustment and more.</p>
          <p>Synergia is available on <a href="#/jupyter">RadiaSoft's public JupyterHub server</a>, which provides access to many open source physics codes through IPython/Jupyter notebooks and browser-based terminals.</p>
