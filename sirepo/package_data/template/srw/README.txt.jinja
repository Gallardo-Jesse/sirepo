These files facilitate the generation and use of input data for machine learning for SRW. They include:

{{ shFileName }}: a shell script that generates input data
{{ pyFileName }}: a python script that runs SRW using the generated data
{{ ymlFileName }}: a YML configuration file for rsopt
{{ readmeFileName }}: this README

{% if hasLibFiles %}
Also included are auxiliary files required for the specific SRW simulation:
{{ libFiles }}
{% endif %}

To generate the data, run 'bash {{ shFileName }}'. This stores the data in the numpy file <>.npy

To then run SRW with that data, run 'python {{ pyFileName }} rsopt_run <>.npy'. Please note:
    - rsopt does the job of running SRW with the stored input data
    - If the machine running SRW has N cores, rsopt will execute in parallel on N - 1 cores
    - SRW will run {{ totalSamples }} times; use caution


The final consolidated output data for use in ML is in two numpy files under the datasets folder. Each is an array
with {{ totalSamples }} entries, one for each run.  
    - beam_intensities_<>.npy: propagated single-e intensity distribution vs horizontal and vertical position
    - parameters_<>.npy: the inputs used for each run


Intermediate output is also available:

data_files/res_int_pr_se_[n].dat:
    propagated single-e intensity distribution vs horizontal and vertical position

beams/beam_[n].npy:
    same information as in data_files, but in numpy format

parameters/values_[n].npy:
